# HandShake
# Inspiration:
Our product was inspired by Hackathons themselves! With the amazing opportunity to meet new people from around the world, we wanted a simple and efficient way to keep in touch with all the new friends we were making. Thus, the idea for Handshake was born!

# What it does:
With so many social media platforms on the internet today, it is becoming increasingly overwhelming to connect with others, especially during quick exchanges. Our Android application aims to solve this issue by providing a seamless device-to-device exchange of all connected social media accounts. With NFC, your Camera, or simple username search, receive and add your new connection across all platforms!

# How we built it: 
Handshake is an Android app built with Java and Kotlin on Android Studio. We used Firebase for its image recognition features to scan barcodes and as a database.

# Challenges we ran into: 
We had some trouble integrating the different components of the app together.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
This was our first time dealing with NFC and QR codes. These features significantly reduced the time needed to transfer information between devices and have been valuable tools to learn.

# What's next for Handshake: 
We would like to add API integrations for all associated social media to directly access user's information easily.
